# tic-tac-toe
So, the best and the most fun way to learn any programming language for me has always been by developing a fun project like a simple game or some project that I would use in my daily life.  So, when I started to learn Python, I started with this No Starch Press published book “Automate The Boring Stuff With Python” which is just awesome and If you are looking for a book to get started learning python, I would recommend you to go through this book. Its very beginner-friendly and it covers almost all the basic topics of python. So, while solving the exercises in this book, I came across this TicTacToe game implementation in python.
